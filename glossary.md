<a id="note1" href="#note1ref">1</a> **Token economy** <br/>
<p> Token economies are data-driven, multiscale, adaptive, and dynamic peer-to-peer economic systems enabled by a blockchain.These systems use cryptographic tokens as information carriers, allowing for economic activities to emerge on top of a shared distributed ledger technology (DLT) enabled infrastructure such as blockchain. DLT creates the conditions for a digital economic game with enforced state-space restrictions, by providing a tamper-proof universal state layer. </p>
    
<a id="note2" href="#note2ref">2</a> **Impact bond** <br/>
<p> A social impact bond is a type of bond where repayment to investors is contingent on the bond's success in achieving certain pre-specified social impact objectives. </p>

<a id="note3" href="#note3ref">3</a> **Bonding curve** <br/>
<p> Token Bonding Curves are continuous liquidity mechanisms which are used in market design for cryptographically-supported token economies whereby tokens are automatically issued using buy and sell functions. Academic literature increasingly refers to bonding curves as "configuration spaces" as Bonding Curves are part of a larger theory of scalar functions that remain invariant under legal changes in state. </p>

<a id="note4" href="#note4ref">4</a>  **Claim** <br/>
Claims are submitted by project participants to report impact or progress towards achieving the project's predetermined outcomes. The *claim mechanism* involves the lifecycle of claims. Claims undergo the stages of submission, evaluation, audit, and resolution. Claims Submission: claims are submitted to prove impact or progress towards achieving the project's predetermined outcomes. Claim Evaluation: submitted claims go through a process of evaluation to verify their validity. Claim Auditing: submitted claims may be audited. Claim Resolution: claims are resolved and completed. During resolution, a dispute could be submitted which would result in subsequent dispute evaluation and resolution. 
    
<a id="note5" href="#note5ref">5</a>  **Dispute** <br/>
<p>   Disputes are submitted to dispute the resolution of a claim<a href="glossary.md#note4" id="note4ref"><sup>4</sup></a>.
    
<a id="note6" href="#note6ref">6</a> **State space** <br/>
<p>   Set of all possible configurations of a system. It is a useful abstraction for reasoning about the behavior of a given system and is widely used in the fields of artificial intelligence and game theory. May be interpreted as that collection of variables which serve to define the system at any point in time. </p>

<a id="note7" href="#note7ref">7</a> **Action space** <br/> <br/>
    The set ![img](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?U%28X_a%3B%20x%29) represents the set of feasible actions, given agent a’s local state space ![img](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?X_a), and the global state ![img](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?X).

<a id="note8" href="#note8ref">8</a> **Configuration space** <br/>
The reachable state space. The configuration space describes the *allowable* state and action space available to agents acting within a system, given its conservation laws. It is a subset of a system's (global) state space, representing all achievable states under the designed mechanisms. Any global properties that are true for all points in the configuration space are true for all possible sequences of actions on the part of agents. It is a manifold characterized by the enforced conservation of one or more desired global properties. The configuration space serves the role of enforcing desirable macro-economic properties, while retaining sufficient degrees of freedom for the agents at the micro level to act according to their own private preferences. </p>

<a id="note9" href="#note9ref">9</a> **Markov chain** <br/>
 <p> A Markov chain is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. In continuous-time, it is known as a Markov process. Markov processes are the basis for general stochastic simulation methods known as Markov chain Monte Carlo. </p>

<a id="note11" href="#note11ref">11</a> **Bond-to-mint** <br/><br/>
    The bond-to-mint mechanism mints bond tokens in exchange of external currency through an agent’s action ![img](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?u_%7Ba%2C%20t%7D). The agent’s action represents a transaction to transfer ![img](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5CDelta%20R_t%20%3A%3D%20r_%7Ba%2Ct%7D%20-%20r_%7Ba%2C%20t&plus;1%7D%20%5Cgeq%200) quantity of external currency into the bonding curve system. 

<a id="note12" href="#note12ref">12</a> **Burn-to-withdraw** <br/><br/>
    The burn-to-withdraw mechanism removes bond tokens to redeem external currency through an agent’s action ![img](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?u_%7Ba%2C%20t%7D). The agent’s action represents a transaction to remove ![img](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5CDelta%20S_t%20%3A%3D%20s_%7Ba%2C%20t%7D%20-%20s_%7Ba%2C%20t&plus;1%7D%20%5Cleq%200) quantity of bond tokens from the bonding curve system. 

<a id="note13" href="#note13ref">13</a> **Attestation** <br/><br/>
    **Attestations** are the act of bonding tokens either towards the success or failure of the project in the risk prediction mechanism, which adjusts the alpha parameter upwards or downwards accordingly.
    
    
<a id="note14" href="#note14ref">14</a> **Pre-initialization Phase** <br/>
<p> The pre-initialization phase is meant to represent all of the activities that occur prior to launch of the bond. This includes all of the prior planning and setup. It includes agreements, expectations, obligations, decisions around bond parameters, initial conditions, payment conditions, roles and rights of stakeholders, et al. During the pre-initialization phase, the bond is set up with an associated wallet and repository and all bond participants are identified with digital IDs, public keys, and credentials. All investments including funding as well as resources, materials, and equipment are agreed upon. At the end of this phase, the bond should be for all intents and purposes ready to launch. </p>
    
<a id="note15" href="#note15ref">15</a> **Initialization Phase** <br/>
<p>     During the Initialization Phase, the bond is launched. All of the parameters, roles and rights, thresholds, conditions, etc. are set. All funds as agreed upon are deposited in appropriate accounts. Initialization is essentially the instantiation of everything that was agreed upon in pre-initialization. </p>

<a id="note16" href="#note16ref">16</a> **Execution Phase** <br/>
<p>     The execution phase is the phase where active bond trading occurs. </p>

<a id="note17" href="#note17ref">17</a> **Dispute Pause Phase** <br/>
<p>     In the Dispute Pause Phase, disputes issued against the bond will undergo external resolution. During this state, all system activity except those directly involved in dispute resolution is paused. </p>

<a id="note18" href="#note18ref">18</a> **Settlement Consideration Pause Phase** <br/>
  In this phase, the bond is evaluated against the Settlement Conditions for success or failure. Similar to the Dispute Pause Phase, all system activity other than settlement consideration activity is paused during this phase. A detailed view of the Settlement process is shown [here](artifacts/SettlementConsiderationPhase.png). 

<a id="note19" href="#note19ref">19</a> **Settlement Phase** <br/>
<p>     During the Settlement Phase, bond tokens are converted into a compatible form and are distributed to the participants in the bond along with any outcomes payments based on the project's success. </p>

<a id="note20" href="#note20ref">20</a> **Impact Token** <br/>
    Impact tokens are community tokens in the ixo ecosystem. They represent social impact achievements and may be awarded at various points to various stakeholders especially at a project's completion. These tokens are considered external to the bonding curve implementation and are intentionally excluded from mention as much as possible to avoid confusion.  

<a id="note21" href="#note21ref">21</a> **Bond Token** <br/>
